# Overview

This site was developed because of my love creating. I do it on a daily base from baking to coding and everything in between. So to get more people out there and get them into DIY and learning from others I have created this site.

# User Stories
All the user stories where managed in the Kanban board which was created inside GitHub Projects. User stories were then prioritized with the MoSCoW approach and the labels on the Kanban board where used to manage this. The Kanban board was split into three columns to manage the various stages of development:

  1. To do: This item hasn't been started yet.
  2. In Progress: This item is actively being worked on in the Backend and Frontend.
  3. Done: All tasks have been completed.

# __Databases__

  Data normalisation to structure each model to help reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. This was used after setting out all of the information required for the site.
